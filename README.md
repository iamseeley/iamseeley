# Hi there, I'm Thomas Seeley
- 🌐 I've been building for the web for the past three years.
- 💻 I develop websites primarily using Javascript.
- 🏆 My go-to web framework is Next.js, but I often find myself reaching for static site generators like 11ty and Gatsby.
- 🎨 I enjoy all things HTML and CSS.
- 📚 Recently, I've been learning Go and Python. 
- 👤 My personal website [tseeley.com](https://tseeley.com/site/home) is served via a static site generator I wrote in Go.
- 🐦 You can follow me on twitter [@iamseeley](https://twitter.com/iamseeley), but I mainly live  @ [tseeley.com](https://tseeley.com/site/home).
